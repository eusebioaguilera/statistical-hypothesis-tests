statistical-hypothesis-tests
============================

This repo contains several statistical hypothesis tests.

Wilcoxon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test)

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used for comparing two related samples. This test is intended to compare 
two samples and test if there are significant differences between them. The assumptions for the compared
data are:

  * Data are paired and come from the same population.
  * Each pair is chosen randomly and independently.
  * The data are measured at least on an ordinal scale, but need not be normal.

The out of the script is the ranking table and the decision if the null hypothesis could be rejected.
